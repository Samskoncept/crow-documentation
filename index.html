            <h3>GETTING STARTED WITH CROW</h3>
            <article>
            <p>CROW offers an all-in-one content management system, or CMS for bloggers, product designers and developers. A CROW
            website is free and it includes content hosting, professionally designed layouts, 24/7 support, and access to our
            user-friendly platform for creating beautiful websites and online stores. </p>
            <p>We also offer tools for creating a portfolio, blogs and professional websites. All of these are available as standalone
            features or as part of the CROW SITE </p>

        <div class="nav-link" id="First Steps">
            <h3>First steps</h3>
            <p>Every CROW site begins on a free subscription. You can explore the platform, upload content, experiment with your
            design, and share your progress with friends and colleagues.</p>
            <p>When you get started, you start with a template of your choice. Templates help to showcase site features and give you an
            idea of how your site can be styled. You can make changes to the template by adding images and customizing colors and
            changing the font.</p>
            <p>When you’re ready to build your site, use the pages panel in the Home menu to create a new page. Then you can add
            sections and rearrange your content to create custom layouts</p>
            <p><b>The Pages Panel</b></p>
            <p>The Pages panel is where you create the structure of your site by adding and arranging pages.</p>
            <p>In the Home menu, click Pages.</p>
            <p>The Pages panel opens on the left side of your screen. Use this panel to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add new pages</li>
                <li>Check Page settings</li>
                <li>Delete Pages</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Tips:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you first create your site, the Pages panel is populated with templates.</li>
                <li>Each line displays a page's title and an icon representing its page type.</li>
                <li>Pages appear in your site's navigation in the order they're placed in the Pages panel.</li>
                <li>A house icon appears to the left of your homepage.</li>
                <li>To add a new page, click + at the top of a navigation section.</li>
                <li>Hover over any page and click <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> to open its page setting</li>
                
            
            <p>On the page settings you can make changes in the General tab which enables you to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Delete Page</li>
                <li>Duplicate Page</li>
                <li>Enable Page</li>
                <li>Add Page Description</li>
                <li>Add Page Title</li>
                <li>Set as Homepage</li>
                <li>Posts per Page</li>
                <li>URL Slug</li>
            </ol>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Hover over any page and click the trash can icon to delete page.</li>
                <li>To add drop-down menus, use folders</li>
                <li>To change the style of your navigation menus, like fonts, colors, and spacing, use site styles</li>
            
            </ul>

        <section class="nav-link" id="Signing Up">
            <h3>Signing Up</h3>
            <p>To have full access to the free CROW platform, you have to be a registered user. Click the register button to get
            started. If you already have an account, click the sign-in button.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="nav-link" id="Choosing a Template">
            <h3>Choosing a template </h3>
            <p>On the current CROW platform, all sites use the same template, with the same features and style options. The design you
            choose when you start with is a starting point, but it doesn't limit the designs or layouts you can create.</p>

            <p>Explore the template store to find a design that fits your vision. We recommend paying more attention to the structure
            and style rather than its example content. The content is there for inspiration, but you can customize it to meet your
            needs.</p>
            <p>Remember, if you decide you want to change the design of your site later, you can always rebuild it using pages, page
            sections, blocks, and style settings.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="nav-link" id="Creating a Design">
            <h3>Creating your design</h3>
            <p>Select different curated font and colour themes to quickly update styles across your entire sites.</p>
            <p><b>Choose a font pack</b></p>
            <p><b>Changing fonts:</b> this guide walks you through changing fonts on your site, including the font style, size, color, and
            spacing. All sites start with default font styles that you can change and adjust in site styles.</p>
            <p><b>How fonts work in Crow</b></p>
            <p>When reviewing the font menu, please note:Font menus include all available font options, including 600 Google fonts and
            1,000 Adobe Fonts. Scroll to browse our full library, or use the menu's search field to search for a specific font.</p>
            <p>To keep menus short, we limit what appears at first, focusing on your recently used fonts and our most popular options.
            Not all formatting options offered by Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts are supported by Crow.</p>
            <p><b>Customize theme colors:</b> You can further customize any theme by setting specific colors for different site elements. Any changes made to a
            theme's colors apply to all areas of your site using that theme</p>
            <p>To edit a theme: While editing a page, click the paintbrush icon, then click Colors.</p>
            <p><b>Choosing compelling images</b></p>
            <p>Select effective visuals to reflect your style and brand.</p>
            <p>Your site's personality is crafted through fonts, colors, and other styling choices, but the imagery visitors see first
            makes a powerful impression. Images add to your overall tone and messageThis guide gives you the tools for choosing
            great images, including how to use stock images if you don’t have your own</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Get inspired</b></li>
                <p>Every project begins as a blank page, and beautiful websites are no exception. That's why we suggest getting inspired
                before you begin creating content</p>
                <p>Exploring what your favorite people, brands, and businesses are doing with their sites can help you visualize what you
                want for your own. Take note of imagery that appeals to you, styles that connect with what you're trying to accomplish,
                and structure that could work for your content or objective.</p>
                <p>If you look at our Crow templates page, you can view real customer examples for each template, providing inspiration and
                insights into each template’s design strengths</p>

                <li><b>Create a cohesive look</b> </li>
                <p>Think of a word or two that sums up the theme or personality of your site. A home goods retailer specializing in modern
                design might choose “minimalist;” a quirky cupcake shop might pick “joyful.”</p>
                <p>Whatever the word is, you can make your site more effective by tying all its elements — images, colors, fonts — to the
                theme, creating a cohesive look.</p>

                <li><b>Find the perfect picture</b></li>
                <p>There are many ways to find images online. While you may be tempted to pull them from a search engine, this can result
                in inferior quality images and run afoul of creators’ copyrights. Often the ideal image is the one you shot yourself.</p>
                <p>To simplify the process of finding high quality imagery without legal issues, we integrated with Unsplash and Getty
                Images to help you find the perfect stock image for your site. The Unsplash and Getty libraries include some of the most
                beautiful editorial and stock photos available anywhere, available for free or a small fee per image, depending on the
                library.</p>
            </ol>
